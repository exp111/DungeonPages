## TODO:
- allow relic usage (click on them to activate)
- add other items
- allow weapon + relic selection after finishing a dungeon
- implement phase system
- move root code into game class
- implement other bonus effects (rerollAny (click on reroll?))
- add advanced monster effects
- add other weapon effects (reroll X, magic X)
- end game check
- proper event system
- reset selectable item on dice click and vice-versa
- find better way to mark dungeons as completed as we also make useable items harder to see

### Later:
- more maps/characters
- rules + help
- fix up character ui
- mobile design
- collected indicator
- disable ability/items/relics if they cant be used
