## TODO:
- add missing relics (markDice (click dice, then tile))
- add other items
- move root code into game class
- implement other bonus effects (rerollAny (click on reroll?))
- add advanced monster effects
- add other weapon effects (reroll X, magic X)
- proper event system
- find better way to mark dungeons as completed as we also make useable items harder to see
- use proper constructors instead of static funcs
- add automatic phase switching
- add visual feedback for once per turn relics

### Later:
- more maps/characters
- rules + help
- fix up character ui
- mobile design
- collected indicator (what did he mean by this)
- disable ability/items/relics if they cant be used
- testing??
