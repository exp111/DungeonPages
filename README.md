## TODO:
- allow relic usage (click on them to activate)
- add other items
- move root code into game class
- implement other bonus effects (rerollAny (click on reroll?))
- add advanced monster effects
- add other weapon effects (reroll X, magic X)
- proper event system
- reset selectable item on dice click and vice-versa
- find better way to mark dungeons as completed as we also make useable items harder to see
- use proper constructors instead of static funcs
- add automatic phase switching
- allow damage ignore/block effect (do dmg on phase end)
- add status indicator ("you'll receive 1 damage")

### Later:
- more maps/characters
- rules + help
- fix up character ui
- mobile design
- collected indicator
- disable ability/items/relics if they cant be used
